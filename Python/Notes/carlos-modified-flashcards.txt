coercion : implicitly changing the type of a value in order to complete an operation correctly
binding : a relationship between a name and something else in a program
method : a function which performs an action on an object
overloading : assigning multiple meanings to the same name in a program
parameter : a variable carrying input in to a function or method
argument : a value passed in to a parameter
interpreted : a language that is executed line-by-line by another program
compiled : a language that is converted from source code in to machine code before it is executed
runtime error : an error in a program due to it performing an illegal operation during its execution
syntax error : an error in a program due to it not conforming to the grammar of the language
operator : a symbol or keyword used to identify an operation to be performed on one or more expressions
literal : a value written in to the code of a program 
is : the python operator that determines if the identity of two objects is the same
== : the python operator that deterimens if the value of two objects is the same
statement : A single instruction in an imperative program
side effect : a change in state of a program outside of the current scope, or a change to the environment outside of a program (due to the program)
block : a sequence of statements and other blocks in a program
referencing environment : collection of variable bindings available within a certain scope of a program
mutable : can be changed 
immutable : cannot be changed
casting : explicitly converting a value of one type to another
strong types : a type system in which operations can only be attempted on data that conforms to the type constraints necessary for the operation
static types : a type system in which the type of values which can be stored in a variable are specified at the time the program is compiled and cannot be changed at run time
dynamic types : a type system in which the type of values stored in variables may change during run time
duck : a typing scheme which determines types are compatible as long as the requested methods or properties are present within the object
short circuit : the type of evaluation of boolean expressions which ends as soon as the final value of the expression can be determined
syntactic sugar : a language construct that is unnecessary but perhaps makes code shorter or easier to read
slicing : the process of taking a subsequence of a sequence by specifying a range with the beginning and ending values separated by a colon
list : a datastructure which contains a sequence of objects and is mutable
tuple : a datastructure which contains a sequence of objects and is immutable
set : a datastructure which does not support order or multiplicity of elements and is mutable
frozen set : a datastructure which does not support order or multiplicity of elements and is immutable
dictionary : a datastructure which relates arbitrary, hashable, and immutable keys to arbitrary values
concatenation : an operation which joins two sequences together in a new sequence
del : the keyword in python used to remove a variable binding (or a key-value relationship from a collection)
/ : floating point division arithmetic operator
// : integer division arithmetic operator
** : exponentiation arithmetic operator
operator Overloading : associating multiple meanings (semantic interpretations) to the same operator
boolean Values : true and false
end of Line Comments : comments comprising the latter half of a line following the # symbol
zero Indexed : The idea that a list or collection begins at 0
remove : A way of modifying a list that takes a value out
insert : A way of modifying a list that adds a value in
reverse : A way of modifying a list that reverses its order
append : A way of modifying a list to add a value to the end of the list. 
extend : A way of modifying a list by adding a sequence of values to it. 
__le__ : A magic method meaning less than or equal to
__ge__ : A magic method meaning greater than or equal to
max : finds the highest value in a sequence
min : finds the lowest value in a sequence
in : Tests if a value is contained within a collection.
not in : tests if a value is not contained within a collection.
elif : a syntactic construct in python for "else if" in java
pass : An operation that tells the program to move onto the next instruction. 
break : A statment that stops a statment early. 
continue : Skips the remainder of a while block and moves to the next iteration of a loop.
collection : A group of values range(5, 10) is an example
global : The scope throughout the entirety of the program, as opposed to a local variable's scope in a function.
def : Allows the creation of new function objects.
lambda : Creates a function object thatt is limited to a single return statement
closures: a capture of the values within an environment associated with a function that was created in that environment
thunk : Functions with no parameters that just return something. 
currying : Converts a function with multiple parameters into a function that has one fewer parameter and returns a function that takes an argument for the remaining parameters
decorator : A higher order function that takes a single function and returns a single function
generator : a function that produces an iterable value that lazily generates each value in its collection
iterators : created by generators, have a next method which returns the next yielded value
streams : a fluent interface for a lazily evaluated collection of values with methods that return other ____'s with some operation applied to them
predicates : Functions that return a boolean value
reducing : making a collection of values in to a single value
type interference : determine a type implicitly but statically
lazy evaluation : When all elements of a iterator are not generated at once, but as needed.
tail recursive : when the very last operation of a function is to make a recursive call
